#CTE'S are temporary table expressions 

#For this question I am using the spotify data.

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the table. Then for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, you need to show their name, 
their average popularity, and label them as "Top Star."

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
